FLIGHT DEAL FINDER - PYTHON PROGRAMME TO GET THE LOWEST FLIGHT DEALS

What I Used 
- SHEETY API to get and store flight data and prices (use data_manager.py)
- API SPREADSHEET to get and store flight data and prices (use data_manager_apiSpreadsheet.py)
- TEQUILA API to get flight deals
- TWILIO to send sms if any lowest flight deal found
- SMTP to send email if any lowest flight deal found

  What To Do
  You can enter your source and destination in a spreadsheet and run the code.
  It'll find if any lowest deal available and will sent a sms and an email.
  Also will update your spreadsheet data accordingly.
